# Data Sources

This work would not be possible without generous support and open data sharing from our allied organizations. Thank you!

## Power Sector Data via Catalyst Cooperative

[Catalyst Cooperative](https://catalyst.coop/) builds and maintains an [open database of electric power sector data](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/) compiled from EIA, FERC, and EPA sources. The dataset describes the fuel use, generation, operating costs, ownership, and emissions of power plants in the United States.

## Proposed Power Plants via LBNL

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab [compile a dataset](https://emp.lbl.gov/queues) of power plants from the interconnection queues of the 7 ISOs plus the 35 largest non-ISO utilities in the United States. In their own words: "Data from these queues ... provide a general indicator for mid-term trends in developer interest."

## Local Opposition to Renewable Energy via RELDI and NREL

The Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative (RELDI) program at Columbia University has compiled a [dataset of local ordinances](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/opposition-renewable-energy-facilities-united-states) that restrict development of wind and solar generation throughout the United States. The authors have generously provided us with interim updates in a machine readable format.

NREL has also compiled a detailed, machine-readable [dataset of wind and solar ordinances](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2022/nrel-releases-comprehensive-databases-of-local-ordinances-for-siting-wind-solar-energy-projects.html).

## Fossil Fuel Infrastructure via EIP

The [Environmental Integrity Project (EIP)](https://environmentalintegrity.org/) shares [data](https://oilandgaswatch.org/) gleaned from the permitting processes for proposed new and expanding oil, gas, and petrochemical infrastructure projects.

## Wind Energy Permitting Jurisdiction via NCSL

The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) compiled a [dataset](https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-wind-energy-siting.aspx) describing which jurisdictions hold siting authority over wind energy projects.

## Federal Land Ownership via USGS

The USGS [Protected Area Database](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas) (PAD) is Americaâ€™s official national inventory of U.S. terrestrial and marine protected areas. The database contains a trove of information about each tract of land, including the specific owner, managing agency, and degree of development restriction. The full details are in their [data dictionary](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/media/files/PADUS_Standard_Tables_1.xlsx).

## Political Boundaries (Counties and Tribal Land) via Census

The US Census produces shapefiles of [US counties (2021)](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/COUNTY/) and [American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) lands](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/AIANNH/), which we use for spatial calculations.
