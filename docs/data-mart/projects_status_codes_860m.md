# projects_status_codes_860m

The EIA defines 12 status codes for generators. We have simplified them down to 9 numbers, in the order a generator would typically go through in its lifecycle. The table is presented in its entirety here for reference.

|3|T|Regulatory approvals received. Not under construction but site preparation could be underway|
|4|U|Under construction, less than or equal to 50 percent complete (based on construction time to date of operation)|
|5|V|Under construction, more than 50 percent complete (based on construction time to date of operation)|
|6|TS|Construction complete, but not yet in commercial operation|
