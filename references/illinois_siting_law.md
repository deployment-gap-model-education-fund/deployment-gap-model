# Illinois State Policy for Wind/Solar
The following is a summary of an [Illinois law](https://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10200HB4412sam001&GA=102&SessionId=110&DocTypeId=HB&LegID=137757&DocNum=4412&GAID=16&SpecSess=&Session=) that attempts to preempt counties from passing overly restrictive permitting ordinances on renewable energy projects. We use it as a baseline against which to compare local ordinances from elsewhere in the country.

## Wind

* setbacks:
  * occupied community buildings: 2.1x tip height
  * participating residences: 1.1x tip height
  * non-participating residences: 2.1x tip height
  * participating property lines: none
  * non-participating property lines: 1.1x tip height
  * public roads: 1.1x tip height
  * utility lines: 1.1x
  * fish and wildlife areas: 2.1x
* Shadow flicker: 30 hours/year for occupied community building or nonparticipating residence
* Sound: hard to summarize because it is defined as [frequency-dependent curves](https://pcb.illinois.gov/documents/dsweb/Get/Document-12261/) depending on the zone of the receiving parcel (basically residential, commercial, or industrial). I used residential land because that is most likely the relevant one and it is the most restrictive. I chose the 500 Hz value because it was the closest to being violated in this [random noise study of a wind farm in IL](https://www.mcleancountyil.gov/DocumentCenter/View/11314/AP-EX-10--Michael-Hankard-INCE-ASA---Power-Point-Presentation-of-Noise-Analysis-Results-1-4-18?bidId=).
  * 7am to 10pm: 58 dBA
  * 10pm to 7am: 47 dBA

## Solar

* setbacks
  * occupied community building: 150 feet
  * non-participating buildings: 150 feet
  * participating property lines: none
  * nonparticipating property lines: 50 feet
  * public roads: 50 feet
* fencing height:
  * 6 foot minimum
  * 25 foot maximum
* height: 20 feet
* Sound: same as wind above
