Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, allowing it to be exported on tankers to overseas markets that would otherwise be inaccessible through pipeline transport. It is produced using liquefaction units—called “trains” by the industry—that remove impurities and then liquefy or condense the gas at sub-zero temperatures.

The Cadiz Plant processes field gas that is mainly gathered from the Utica and Marcellus shale formations. MarkWest first received a permit in 2012 to construct the initial unit (Cadiz I) and has since added a 40,000 barrel/day de-ethanization unit and two 200 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) natural gas processing units (Cadiz II and Cadiz III). The Cadiz I was designed to process 140 mmsfcd of field gas to produce pipeline-grade natural gas, propane, and natural gas liquids.  Cadiz II and Cadiz III increased that capacity to 525 mmscfd.

The Cadiz plant is connected to the Appalachia-to-Texas (Atex) pipeline, which originates in Washington County, PA. Through Atex, Cadiz connects to the MarkWest Houston Plant in Pennsylvania, the Blue Racer Natrium plant in West Virginia, and the Utica East Ohio Scio plant. According to MarkWest, all natural gas liquids (NGLs) “other than purity ethane . . . produced at [the] Cadiz Complex, Seneca Complex, Harmon Creek Complex, Majorsville Complex, Mobley Complex and Sherwood Complex are gathered to the Houston Complex or to the Hopedale Complex through a system of NGL pipelines to allow for fractionation into purity NGL products.”  There are also pipelines that connect Cadiz to MarkWest’s Seneca and Utopia complexes for transportation of propane, ethane, and/or heavier liquids.

Additional notes:
-	The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has approved Shell’s Falcon Ethane Pipeline, which would extend from the MarkWest Houston Facility to the Shell Chemical Appalachia Petrochemical Complex.

The facility will also include a storage tank anticipated to be able to store up to 70,000 metric tons of liquid anhydrous ammonia.

Gulf Coast Ammonia predicts that the plant will have an annual production capacity of up to 1.35 million metric tons per year. The ammonia produced would then be transported either via Air Products’ pipelines or marine docks, which would be managed by Oiltanking North America.

Notably, the air separator unit will be built and operated on property leased from Eastman Chemical. The plant will use gaseous hydrogen and nitrogen to produce liquid ammonia.

AS 1/23/24 - there's also an anhydrous ammonia storage tank permitted under RN110769148 (Gulf Coast Ammonia) NSR permit 156349

From SK: The MarkWest Hopedale Fractionation Facility is a midstream facility in Jewett, Harrison County, Ohio that processes natural gas liquids (NGLs) from processing plants in both the Marcellus and Utica shale Fields. Hopedale currently has a processing capacity of 240,000 barrels per day (bpd), which is double its capacity from 2015.6 Additionally, MarkWest plans an expansion that will further increase the Hopedale complex’s capacity by 80,000 bpd.7

According to MarkWest, “[a]ll NGLs, other than purity ethane . . . produced at [the] Cadiz Complex, Seneca Complex, Harmon Creek Complex, Majorsville Complex, Mobley Complex and Sherwood Complex are gathered to the Houston Complex or to the Hopedale Complex through a system of NGL pipelines to allow for fractionation into purity NGL products.”8 Since December of 2018, MarkWest began transporting propane and butane from Hopedale to the Marcus Hook Facility on the eastern border of Pennsylvania “where it is loaded onto marine vessels and delivered to domestic and international markets.”9",OH,0634005042,46700 Giacobbi Rd,43986,EIP Test Account,MarkWest Hopedale Fractionation Facility,909,909,Keene Kelderman,"{'createdAt': '2021-05-20T19:13:45.411Z', 'updatedAt': '2024-12-04T17:48:34.628645Z', 'version': 245}",1321,,,,,,

Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Upon entering the plant the gas goes through a molecular sieve which is
designed to remove liquids from the gas stream. Heaters are used to regenerate the mol sieve on a regular
basis to remove the water and hydrocarbons. After the mol sieve the gas will be cooled through a
cryogenic plant with mechanical refrigeration which serves to remove propane and heavier hydrocarbons
in the gas stream. The natural gas liquids from the new plant will then pass through a stabilizer to remove
any carry-over methane and ethane in the liquid stream. The remaining gas stream (mostly methane and
ethane) will pass through the deethanizers so that ethane can be separated and recovered from the gas
stream. The ethane will then be transferred via pipeline to market. The remaining natural gas will pass

Mont Belvieu Fractionator (until 5/6/2014)

The Mont Belvieu Fractionator operates under Title V Operating Permit No. O‐612.
O615 is for the co-located Mont Belvieu Terminal.

Belvieu Fractionator separates mixed natural gas liquids (NGLs) into speciated products and transfers the products via pipeline network to the Mont Belvieu Terminal. The Mont Belvieu Terminal utilizes solution-mined
caverns for the storage of LSNG, LPG, light olefin feedstocks, and light naphtha. The terminal is connected through a distribution network of interstate and intrastate pipelines to third party storage, refining, and petrochemical facilities as well as to the neighboring Targa owned and operated Mont Belvieu Plant. No liquid processing is done at this terminal.

Three expansion projects at the existing Mont Belvieu Fractionation Complex, including: construction of two 100,000 barrel per day (bpd) natural gas liquids fractionation trains (Trains 5 and 6); a subsequent expansion to construct three additional 120,000 bpd fractionators (Trains 7-9); and a third expansion project to authorize the construction of Train 10. This facility has been expanding incrementally since 2013.
