According to the project's second construction extension, issued October 4, 2019, construction on the CCI Corpus Christi Condensate Splitter Facility was expected to begin by December 19, 2019. TCEQ issued two extensions to commence construction on the CCI Condensate Splitter on 11/7/2016 and 10/4/2019. A start of construction notification was submitted on 5/25/2018; however, aerial imagery confirms that construction has not commenced. EIP submitted a letter to TCEQ on 4/10/2020, asking the Agency to confirm if construction had commenced and if the permit is still valid. The permit is currently being reviewed by TCEQ staff.

"" Construction was limited to site prep, foundations, and manufacturing 2 gas turbines"" Need to see if that's inline with the FERC definition - check next monthly report

Construction expected to begin summer 2021; project to be completed by 2025 (delayed by 2 years).

FID delayed by 2 years, originally expected in 2020 (https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tellurian-lng/us-allows-tellurian-to-start-site-prep-work-on-louisiana-driftwood-lng-export-plant-idUSL1N28M11X).

-Operation of the LNG Facility and Pipeline would require a permanent workforce of 539 new employees; Driftwood anticipates hiring 41 new permanent employees to operate the Pipeline = 498 permanent jobs promised to operate the LNG terminal (FEIS pg 304)
-At its peak, Driftwood estimates construction of the Project would require about 6,430 workers (peak of 5,400 for the LNG Facility and 1,030 for the Pipeline, including 137 workers for construction of compressor stations) (FEIS pg 90)

""We produce PO through two distinct technologies, one of which yields tertiary butyl alcohol (“TBA”) as the co-product and the other of which yields SM as the co-product. The two technologies are mutually exclusive with dedicated assets for manufacturing either PO/TBA or PO/SM. PO is an intermediate commodity chemical and is a precursor of polyols, propylene glycol, propylene glycol ethers and butanediol. PO and derivatives are used in a variety of durable and consumable items with key applications such as polyurethanes used for insulation, automotive/furniture cushioning, coatings, surfactants, synthetic resins and several other household usages. We are currently constructing a world-scale PO/TBA plant in Houston, Texas. Once completed the plant will have the capacity to produce 470 thousand tons of PO and 1.0 million tons of tertiary butyl alcohol per year. The project is expected to start-up at the end of 2022 and expected to result in total capital expenditures of approximately $3.4 billion.""

A public hearing was held in Brownsville on May 28, 2019, and the public comment period ended on June 24, 2019. During the comment period, the Shrimpers and Fishermen of the Rio Grande Valley submitted timely comments (as did several hundred other individuals, community groups, and government entities), and requested a contested case hearing on the Draft Permit. The hearing was held on February 8, 2021 and a decision was issued on May 21, 2021.

SOAH Docket No. 582-21-0111 (issued 5/21/2021) recommended that the draft permit be revised to adjust emissions limits for some of the proposed heaters, and to require additional control technology for fugitive emissions.

Issuance 4 (issued ) - 10 emissions units - This CDPHE APCD Construction Permit
Modification Application is being supplied for two purposes: first, it seeks certain revisions to the permit that relate directly to a Compliance Advisory dated April 20, 2018, issued by the Division to DCP in Case #2018-057 and discussions between DCP and Division enforcement staff regarding the Compliance Advisory; and second, it seeks to generally update and clarify certain aspects of the Issuance 3 permit.
The Compliance Advisory concerns certain noncompliance that DCP voluntarily self-disclosed to the Division in December 2017. In communications dated June 29, 2018 from outside counsel for DCP to Division enforcement staff, DCP responded to a Division request to expressly describe specific projects DCP intends to implement at Lucerne 2 that relate to the voluntary self-disclosure, along with a proposed timeline/schedule for the completing those projects. To meet the estimated project implementation deadlines provided in the June 29 communication, DCP clarified that it would require permission from the Division to: (a) finalize and submit a permit application and (b) commence construction of the projects prior to permit issuance and, possibly, prior to entering a formal compliance order on consent to resolve the claims in the Compliance Advisory. It is our understanding that the Division has endorsed the projects DCP proposed and, for that reason, the need for this permit modification application. Additionally, DCP understands that it is the Division’s strong desire that DCP adhere to, as is practicable, the project implementation schedule provided for in the June 29 communication. This application effects DCP’s June 29 project commitments to the Division.

The Majorsville Processing Plant is used as a gathering station for gas wells throughout southwest
Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Upon entering the plant the gas goes through a molecular sieve which is
designed to remove liquids from the gas stream. Heaters are used to regenerate the mol sieve on a regular
basis to remove the water and hydrocarbons. After the mol sieve the gas will be cooled through a
cryogenic plant with mechanical refrigeration which serves to remove propane and heavier hydrocarbons
in the gas stream. The natural gas liquids from the new plant will then pass through a stabilizer to remove
any carry-over methane and ethane in the liquid stream. The remaining gas stream (mostly methane and
ethane) will pass through the deethanizers so that ethane can be separated and recovered from the gas
stream. The ethane will then be transferred via pipeline to market. The remaining natural gas will pass

However, in November 2021, PHMSA issued a proposed rule to rescind the final rule authorizing nationwide transportation. Pursuant to a September 2022 Congressional Interest Status Report, DOT projects that PHMSA would finalize this proposed rule on March 13, 2023. If promulgated along these lines, this rule would suspend authorization of LNG transportation by rail pending completion of a rulemaking evaluating the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 171-180 or by June 30, 2024, whichever is earlier. DOT’s most recent statement contemplates issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the rulemaking by March 20, 2023.""

Plaquemines LNG is currently seeking approval from FERC to increase authorized liquefaction capacity to 27.2 million tons of LNG per year. According to Plaquemines LNG, this increase is due to refinements in the conditions and assumptions used in calculating maximum potential output and would not require any design modifications.","Carbon Capture from Industry, LNG Export Terminal or Liquefaction Plant",True,"Company website:

According to the project's draft environmental impact statement, commissioning was initially expected in the third quarter of 2022. United States Coast Guard (USGS) and Maritime Administration (MARAD) suspended the application review schedule for the SPOT deepwater port license application on May 31, 2019, giving the company more time to submit additional information necessary to complete environmental review. The timeline was restarted on October 23, 2019, and the regulatory stop ended on February 5, 2020. Given the delay and the project's construction schedule, completion is likely to be pushed back to 2023 or later.

Comments submitted on 11/23/2020 argue that LDEQ can't modify the permit because it already expired, 60 months after issuance, and that the company failed to begin actual construction (see op status source, public comments too big to download) The methanol project would create 75 new direct jobs with an average annual salary of $71,400, plus benefits. In addition, the project would result in an estimated 350 new permanent indirect jobs while generating 800 construction jobs at peak building activity.

The reaction of chlorine with ethylene creates 1,2-dichloroethane, which is commonly called ethylene dichloride (EDC). EDC cracking units, in turn, split EDC into vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and hydrochloric acid. These two processes usually, but not always, occur on the same site.

The Willow Lake facility consists of two (2) gas processing plants to recover natural gas liquids (NGL): Willow Lake 1 consists of a turbo-expander cryogenic separation system that removes a significant fraction of the C2+ compounds from the cooled gas stream, and Willow Lake 2 consists of a refrigerated Joule-Thompson (RJT) plant that also removes C2+ compounds using a combination of mechanical refrigeration and a Joule-Thompson effect. The NGL streams from these units are routed to pressurized storage tanks prior to truck loading and transport. Willow Lake 1 has a maximum processing capacity of 20 MMSCFD of natural gas. Willow Lake 2 has a maximum processing capacity of 35 MMSCFD of natural gas.

""In the cryogenic unit the inlet gas is cooled by cross exchanging the inlet gas with cold residue gas, cold natural gas liquids (NGLs), and propane refrigeration.

The cold inlet gas exiting the top of the cold separator flow through the expanders and reflux exchangers. The expanders reduce the pressure of the inlet gas and in doing so extracts work from the gas and results in condensation of additional NGLs. The two-phase mixture exiting the expanders is fed to the upper section of the demethanizers, which strips methane from the NGLs. The NGLs exit the bottom of the demethanizers with a low residual concentration of methane. The remainder of the inlet feed gas (residue gas) exits the top of the demethanizers. The cold residue gas is cross exchanged with the inlet gas to recover the refrigeration. The warm residue gas exiting the cryogenic units is compressed by electric motor driven compressors to pipeline pressure. Prior to discharge to the pipeline, the residue gas is filtered and metered.

“The feedstocks will be provided by the co-located Pretreatment Unit (“PTU”) owned and operated by Artesia PTU LLC (“APTU”), and potentially by other suppliers. NMED issued a separate minor source permit, NSR Permit No. 9015, on February 15, 2021 and assigned Agency Interest No. 39767 for the PTU… Initially, the RDU was added to the Navajo Artesia Refinery’s air permit via a Significant Revision that resulted in NMED issuing NSR Permit No. PSD-NM-0195-M38 on September 20, 2019. Since permit issuance, the scope of project expanded to include the PTU, with ARDC being the owner and operator of the RDU, and APTU being the owner and operator of the PTU. As such, the RDU will be removed from the Navajo Artesia Refinery’s air permit via an Administrative Revision upon NMED’s issuance of the stand-alone RDU minor source permit. The parallel application for the PTU minor source air permit was submitted separately, and NMED has issued the resulting air permit.”

The plant configuration will produce carbon dioxide at an industrial scale. The estimated qualified investment of the plant and its facilities is $319,650,000. The projected estimate for the purchase of the land for the plant and its facilities is $5,350,000. (313 app, pg 27)

I assume there will be a Phase II project, but the company hasn’t submitted a 313 application for the expansion yet (AS 11/23)

Applicant plans to design and construct a manufacturing facility that will utilize woody biomass as a feedstock. The process will produce syngas, which can be further processed into either renewable gasoline or renewable hydrogen.
The project will utilize a GTI developed bubbling fluidized bed biomass gasification technology that processes one-inch chipped wood into syngas, which will be converted into crude methanol and finally into gasoline, LPG and CO2. Alternatively, the syngas can be used to create hydrogen and CO2.
The primary product will be renewable gasoline. If the facility manufactures renewable industrial hydrogen, that product is at pipeline specification purity and pressure, molecularly identical to natural gas-produced hydrogen, and becomes a fungible product once in the pipeline. The facility will also produce CO2 at industrial scale.

Customers can then use this carbon negative attribute to offset the environmental impacts of their own processes. Renewable gasoline produced at the facility will be used to satisfy low carbon fuel standards in Calfornia and other markets. Though Applicant is not primarily engaged in activities related to renewable
energy electric generation, Applicant will be producing a continuous 11.5 megawatts of renewable electricity, which the facility will utilize to meet over 75 percent of the facility's power needs, and will purchase less than 25 percent of the facility's power needs from the grid.",,,0.22,20.47,Alexandra Shaykevich,4529,4529,Alexandra Shaykevich,Spindletop Renewable Gasoline Refinery - Initial Construction,"{'createdAt': '2021-11-23T12:30:45.912Z', 'updatedAt': '2024-04-08T17:49:13.043627Z', 'version': 6}",,2023-01-23T00:00:00Z,325.0,2024,,,,,,

- Removal of three Waukesha F3515GS1 compression engines (EUs LMGP-42, LMGP-43, and LMGP-44), these units would not be installed and instead five additional (for a project total of 9) electric-driven compression engines would be used.

Replacing existing compressor engines at the Smokey Compressor Station (EUs SCS-1 & SCS-14) with new units (SCS-16 & SCS-17). Correction on the emission points for the three Solar Centaur turbines—each will have its own stack—not a combined stack as previously listed.

These changes are minor, and the PTE is very similar to those listed in PTC17023 with a reduction in HAPs, since the PTE is equal to PTC17023, no new modeling or public comment period is warranted.

""The Project includes other changes to Phillips 66's facilities. The Santa Maria facility in San Luis Obispo County that currently provides crude oil feedstocks to the Rodeo facility will be idled and decommissioned. The existing Phillips 66 crude oil pipeline network from the gathering fields in central California to the Rodeo facility will no longer be necessary to support the reconfigured facility and will be active, but out of service. To account for the idling of the Santa Maria facility and to maintain production levels during the transition process, the Project proposes to increase deliveries of crude oil across the Marine Terminal on a short-term and transitional basis. An increase of deliveries across the Marine Terminal would require a modification of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District permit for the Rodeo Refinery. This interim increase is not a Marine Terminal expansion, nor does it require any physical construction.

FastTrack project description

""Louisiana Green Fuels (LGF) plans to build a deeply carbon-negative renewable fuels plant at the Port of Columbia in Caldwell Parish, Louisiana.  It will have the lowest Carbon Intensity (CI) of any renewable liquid fuels facility in the world.  The bio-refinery will use forestry residues or biomass, mostly from managed pine plantations in the region, to manufacture approximately 2400 barrels per day of renewable diesel and renewable naphtha for shipment by rail to California.  The fuel products will qualify for ""carbon credits"" under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the US EPA's Renewable Fuel Standards.  The carbon dioxide produced in the refining process will be captured, injected and permanently stored deep underground in one or more US EPA-regulated Class VI wells, a process known as Carbon Capture and Sequestration or CCS.  Also, to power the refinery operations with ""green"" energy, LGF plans to construct a biomass-fueled electric power generating plant immediately adjacent to the refinery.  It will generate additional volumes of carbon dioxide which will also be captured and stored in the CCS component of the project.  Most fossil fuel refineries have a CI of about +100.  The combination of the biomass-derived fuel and electric power and the use of CCS for both plants will lower the CI of this project to an estimated minus 238.  The very low minus number indicates that operation of the refinery will in fact improve the environment and provide a significant needed offset toward the goal of a net-carbon zero economy.  The impact on the local economy of northeast Louisiana will be substantial and enduring.""",,,38.07,91.49,Alexandra Shaykevich,4834,4834,PB,Louisiana Green Fuels Renewable Fuels Plant - Initial Construction,"{'createdAt': '2022-02-16T16:46:45.031Z', 'updatedAt': '2024-09-05T20:01:13.85832Z', 'version': 13}",,2023-06-09T00:00:00Z,700.0,2026,,,,,,

Inspection conducted 8/19/2021 confirmed construction had not commenced on CRYO 2 (see EIP's commencement of construction letter and DEP's response) From LGM on 2/3/2022

More bad news for ETC Revolution - this time for their processing plant in Smith Township, Washington County.  Thankfully, a letter from EIP prompted the PA DEP to do the right thing.  I've provided a brief description of what has happened so far and will provide any additional updates as they become available.

On January 3, 2022, in response to a letter and investigation conducted by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) in November 2021, Pennsylvania DEP informed ETC Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. (ETC) that it had failed to commence construction of Unit 2 at the Revolution Cryogenic Plant within 18-months of authorization, as is required under 25 Pa. Code 127.13(b) and Section A. General Conditions, Condition 12 of GP-5 permits.  A GP-5 is a state-issued general permit that covers air emissions from Natural Gas Compression Stations, Processing Plants, and Transmission Stations.

Because the company did not meet the required 18-month limit to commence construction, ETC’s authorization to construct and operate Unit 2 expired.  As a result, if ETC wishes to construct and operate Unit 2, they will have to reapply for authorization from the PA DEP under a new GP-5 application.  And ETC may need to seek additional local approvals from Smith Township, Washington County.

The Revolution Cryogenic Plant is located in Smith Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. ETC received authorization to construct and operate Unit 1 of the Revolution Cryogenic Plant in August 2016 then received authorization to construct and operate Unit 2 in August 2018, which has now expired. Had Unit 2 been constructed and begun operation, potential emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), and Carbon Monoxide (CO) from the facility would have doubled to 30.02 tons per year (tpy), 60.35 tpy, and 69.01 tpy respectively.

Today is the last day ETC has to file an appeal of the PA DEP's decision - it is unclear if the company will do so, but EIP will keep everyone posted on the situation.",14906807.0,55535162.0,0.34,41.7,Alexandra Shaykevich,4847,4847,Alexandra Shaykevich,Revolution Cryogenic Plant - Unit 2,"{'createdAt': '2022-02-25T00:08:45.74Z', 'updatedAt': '2024-11-12T17:44:04.250839Z', 'version': 54}",,2024-11-12T15:25:23.318Z,,Unknown,2021,,,,,

""We have also announced steps to produce blue ammonia from our ammonia production network. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our Board of Directors authorized projects that will enable the annual production of up to 1.25 million tons of blue ammonia from our existing network starting in 2024. The projects will involve constructing units at our Donaldsonville and Yazoo City complexes that dehydrate and compress CO2, a process essential for CO2 transport via pipeline to sequestration sites. Management expects that, once the units are in service and sequestration is initiated, we could sequester up to 2.5 million tons of CO2 per year (2 million tons at Donaldsonville and 500,000 tons at Yazoo City). Under current regulations, the projects would be expected to qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per tonne of CO2 sequestered.
Construction of the units at the Donaldsonville complex is expected to begin in 2022 and to be completed in 2024, with an estimated total cost of $200 million.

Construction expected to commence in 2024, operational by 2027 (https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/nutrien-eyeing-la-site-for-world-s-largest-clean-ammonia-facility-271652909187) There is an existing CCS project that serves the Nutrien ammonia/nitric acid/ammonium nitrate plant in Geismar (Agency Interest No. 3732). This proposed project would use the same CCS system. After capture, Denbury Carbon Solutions will utilize the carbon for enhanced oil recovery, after which it is sequestered underground.

The new plant is expected to have annual production capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of clean ammonia, with approximately 1.8 million metric tons per year of CO2 to be captured.

ATR Process Description (V10 addendum)
The Nutrien Clean Ammonia Plant will use Autothermal Reforming Technology (ATR), which converts a mixture of natural gas, steam, and oxygen into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In general, the autothermal process utilizes energy absorbing and energy releasing chemical reactions to sequester hydrogen from natural gas as opposed to a conventional process that obtains most of its energy for driving the reaction from the combustion of natural gas. C02 is captured from the synthesis gas by being absorbed into a cold methanol solution. The C02 is released from the cold methanol at low pressure, and subsequently compressed on site. After being compressed, custody is transferred to a separate company responsible for the transport and geological sequestration of the C02 in a secure underground containment site. Hydrogen will be separated from the syngas stream, purified, and introduced into the ammonia synthesis loop. Some hydrogen and other residual gases are returned to the front of the process to recover energy.
In the ammonia synthesis loop, nitrogen is mixed with hydrogen and converted into ammonia, which is then condensed and transferred to refrigerated storage tanks. An Air Separation Unit (ASU) located on site cryogenically separates air to provide the nitrogen for the synthesis loop as well as the oxygen for the ATR.
The use of ATR technology allows for production of a nearly C02 free syngas and subsequent production of clean ammonia. Over 90% of the plant's C02 emissions will be captured and stored.

pg 68:
The capital investment in the Project is estimated at $2 billion. It is anticipated that the Project will create approximately 35 permanent direct jobs with an annual average salary of approximately $100,000, and approximately 500-800 FTE construction jobs with a peak of 1,000-2,000 construction contractors.

Blue Bayou plans to design and construct a new low carbon ammonia production facility.

So called “blue” hydrogen will be produced on-site with auto-thermal methane reformers with oxygen generated from on-site air separation units (“ASUs”), and together with nitrogen from the ASUs, these gases will be used as raw feedstocks for the production of blue ammonia. Carbon dioxide will be captured in a synthesis gas treatment plant and from the air separation unit(s) and compressed for transportation by others by pipeline to an off-site sequestration well site.

located on 19.36 acres",Initial construction of the facility.,"Chemical Recycling Plant, Renewable Diesel or Gasoline Refinery",True,"Construction began in 10/2021 (see commencement of construction notification)

Operations began in dec 2022 https://www.fulcrum-bioenergy.com/sierra-biofuels website states 11 million tons biofuels from ~175,000 tons MSW

Already constructed: a state-of-the-art Feedstock Processing Facility (""FPF"") located off-site in Mustang, Storey County, Nevada. The FPF receives MSW that has already undergone significant recycling efforts. The waste, which would otherwise be disposed of at the adjacent Lockwood Regional Landfill, is diverted to the FPF where it is then further processed into a MSW-derived
feedstock that the Project uses to produce a renewable fuel. The Feedstock is delivered in bulk form to the Site, whereupon it may be temporarily stored, before being fed into the gasifier.

The Feedstock will be converted to SPK fuel through a three-step process comprising steam reforming gasification; FT liquids synthesis; and hydroprocessing/fractionation upgrading. In the first step, steam reforming gasification, the feedstock will be converted into a syngas that, after removal of impurities, is composed primarily of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The FT liquids synthesis, step three, converts the syngas into FT liquid hydrocarbons using conventional fixed-bed catalyst FT reactors. The final step, hydroprocessing/fractionation upgrading, converts the FT liquids to SPK fuel. Gasification consists of three major units: a steam reformer, a carbon trim cell (""CTC"") and a partial oxidation hydrocarbon reforming (""POx"") unit",14631020.0,54507721.0,0.94,56.02,Alexandra Shaykevich,5736,5736,Alexandra Shaykevich,Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels Plant - Initial Construction,"{'createdAt': '2022-10-25T13:40:48.76Z', 'updatedAt': '2024-11-19T17:45:12.977672Z', 'version': 58}",,2023-05-04T00:00:00Z,,,,,,,,

https://www.chemengonline.com/plug-power-and-olin-launch-jv-to-construction-hydrogen-plant-in-louisiana/?printmode=1 project is being developed by a join venture between the Olin Corporation and Plug Power.

project description, LPDES app, pg 50
Olin produces hydrogen as a byproduct. Rather than vent the waste hydrogen to the atmosphere, this project will capture it for processing to be distributed and used primarily as a clean fuel source for material handling purposes.
The process of preparing the hydrogen for use as a clean fuel source creates no atmospheric emissions… The primary source of air emissions from the Project will be water vapor associated with the operation of the cooling towers as part of the liquefaction process. Based on the water quality data and the proposed cooling tower specifications, the anticipated emissions are well below the regulatory thresholds… The Project also proposes to operate a fossil fuel generator for backup power to the pumps… Ultimately, the backup generator will be replaced with a Plug manufactured fuel cell that will be operated using the green hydrogen produced at the facility… air emissions are de minimis and exempt from air permitting requirements.
